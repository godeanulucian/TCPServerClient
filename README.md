# TCPServerClient


Create a client-server application for file transfer. The server will have set a directory
from where the files will be downloaded. The client will ask for the list of files in the
directory using the ls command and retrieve a file using the get file_name command.
The transport protocol used will be TCP. The server will be iterative.
